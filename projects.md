# Passive Solar Greenhouses

Greenhouse Engineering is a central pillar of the Resilience Rangers' philosophy. It's one of the most direct ways we achieve resilience by overcoming issues of food insecurity. Because of this, you'll notice that many of our badges are designed to support this style of intensive agriculture.

It may seem counterintuitive to create greenhouses when the average global temperature is increasing. However, these controlled growing environments are the antidote for food insecurity and swinging weather patterns. Think about the problems our food systems will continue to face in the next century:

- Unpredictable weather patterns
- Drought
- Extreme heat
- Cold snaps
- Water shortages
- Pests
- Plant diseases and fungi
- Extreme wind
- Hail
- Flooding
- Shrinking arable land
- Shrinking yields

A greenhouse is an amazing tool that is capable of providing adaptations for every single one of these problems!

Water usage can be greatly reduced. Crops are sheltered from high wind, hail, and even flooding (to an extent). Shade can be provided to limit solar gain in the hot afternoon sun. 

Greenhouses can be thermally insulated to protect against drastic temperature swings. The growing season can be extended on either side of the summer, to make up for lack of productivity during those scorching months. Thermal insulation cuts down or eliminates the need to use fossil fuels to heat or cool a greenhouse, which is going to be a critical challenge as energy prices increase. They can also allow for warmer weather and tropical plants to be grown at much higher latitudes.

Massive amounts of these passive solar (insulated) greenhouses have been built already in China ([source](https://journals.ashs.org/horttech/view/journals/horttech/20/3/article-p626.xml){:target="_blank"}). The area encompassed by solar greenhouses is expected to reach 1.5-1.7 million hectares by 2020 ([source](http://www.geyseco.es/geystiona/adjs/comunicaciones/304/C02330001.pdf){:target="_blank"}).

Using only geothermal heating, growers like [Greenhouse in the Snow](https://greenhouseinthesnow.com){:target="_blank"} has been able to produce citrus fruit through harsh Nebraska winters. Check out the [accompanying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD_3_gsgsnk){:target="_blank"} to get an idea of what's possible.

In addition to providing food security, a greenhouse is a perfect laboratory for science education, and a way to gain practical engineering experience.

# Regenerative Agriculture Projects

Building greenhouses isn't the only solution proposed by Resilience Rangers. In general, we stress the importance of regenerative agriculture and permaculture practices. There is much work to be done to make our food systems resilient, mostly through observing and mimicking the systems we see in nature. Where possible, we wish to move beyond organic or sustainable food production and into "carbon farming" a.k.a. regenerative practices in order to leave a better quality of life for our planet and our children.

# Purpose

Get together within our community to create resilient systems.

We can cure our learned helplessness and truly thrive in an inhospitable world. Many opportunities organically emerge when we work together as a community. Check out our [badges](/badges) for more examples of resilient community infrastructure.
