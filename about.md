### Scouting Redesigned for a Changing World

Scouting is a fun activity that many of us remember fondly from our childhood. However, it's long past time for an update. Many of the activities from Boy or Girl Scouts does little to prepare us for the challenges of the 21st century:

- Climate change
- Sustainability
- Rising energy costs and obtaining low carbon energy
- Food and resource security
- Loss of biodiversity
- Pollution
- Affordable education and housing
- Gender and wealth inequality
- Droughts and flooding
- Disaster preparedness and security

Rather than selling cookies, we need to be learning to grow our own food! But the challenges we face now and in the near future can seem daunting. It's easy for even conscientious folks to throw up our hands and say there's nothing any one individual can do to effect our current situation. That's where Resilience Rangers come into the picture. 

Resilience Rangers offer an inclusive and _positive_ program for growth and skill development. Our badge system can be used as a guide to facilitate coordination and the learning of vital skills to prepare ourselves and our children to be resilient. Let's build the communities of tomorrow today.
