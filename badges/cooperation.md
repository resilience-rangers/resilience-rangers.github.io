##### Know the following:

<!-- Basic government and parliamentary groundwork. - Branches + committees condensed. -->

Cooperatives - what are they and why is it a good idea to organize local Resilience Rangers as a cooperative?

The four major committees (Procurement, Production, Education, Security) and the purpose of each.

Name some other types of committees and tell what they can be useful for.

What are meeting templates and how are they used?

How your admissions process works.

##### Do the following:

Devise a new meeting template and contribute it if possible (if it's general enough for anyone else to benefit from). It doesn't need to be used so much as it needs to demonstrate knowledge of the template system.

Mediate or otherwise be an active participant in at least ten meetings run within this framework.

##### Note:

There is an accompanying guide to answer the questions posed above that is currently in the works, check this space at a later date or reach out to us at info@resiliencerangers.org with questions or comments.
