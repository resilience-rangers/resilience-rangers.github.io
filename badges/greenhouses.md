What is the difference between a greenhouse, hoop house, hightunnel, cold frame, shade house, etc. Can you list other crop protection/season extension methods?

What are some of the advantages of using different geometries when designing a greenhouse? How do you determine the best angle of incidence?

What is geothermal heating and cooling? What is an earth battery? What is a cold sink? How can these techniques be used to warm or cool a greenhouse? 

What is a passive solar greenhouse? What is a Walipini? Find at least three major implementations of passive solar greenhouses. Compare and contrast the construction and operation techniques. What works well and doesn't work?

What is the result of adding thermal mass to a greenhouse? What are some ways to achieve this?

What is the difference between the sun's angle during the soltices? How can greenhouses be designed to provide sunlight during winter as well as shade from the summer sun?

How can insulating a greenhouse reduce usage of fossil fuels? What are some other materials that can provide insulation to a greenhouse? List the insulative R value for common types of greenhouse covers, traditional glazing, and various poly plastics. Compare and contrast these materials in terms of materials cost, energy savings, durability, and how green the materials are.

Describe how you would provide, heat, ventilation, shade, air filtration, pest protection, humidity in using both high tech and low tech solutions for managing a greenhouse.

Construct and operate a greenhouse and operate it for at least an entire season. Produce meaningful market-ready products from it be it, produce, seedlings, flowers, medicinal herbs, etc.
