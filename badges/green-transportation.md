What are biofuels? What is a carbon neutral fuel? Name three places where biofuels could be used in the current transportation sector. Be able to articulate which type of bio-fuel you think has the least impact on the planet and why.

List as many electric vehicles as you can. Talk about places we could replace fossil fuel engines with electric motors. 

How could cargo bikes and other small bike-like vehicles be used instead of cars or trucks for short trips? How could we better design cities and communities to be serviceable by bicycles. Compare that with cities like Amsterdam where biking is commonplace. What works and what doesn't?

Replace at least 500 kilometers of your personal transportation needs by riding a bike*. You can also ride an electric bike, or other electric vehicle. Bonus points if it is charged by renewables. 

<p style="font-size:1em">*Don't just ride around to get the 500 km, the intention is that you replace some of your otherwise car driven commuting with an electric vehicle, and you do it enough to make it a habit.</p>
