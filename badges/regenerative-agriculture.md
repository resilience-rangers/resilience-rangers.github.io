Know the following:

What is Permaculture?

What is Holistic Management?

Differences between keyline design vs swales?

How does soil sequester carbon?

Which agricultural processes can contribute to sequestration?

Which plants are best at trapping carbon in the soil?

Do the following:

Mark contours on a chosen piece of land using an a-frame level or similar surveying method. Be able to create a map of your plot with the contours shown.

Plant enough cover crops or other nitrogen fixers as is appropriate for your situation that you can use, meaning chop & drop, mulch, compost, etc.

Fill a productive niche for given piece of land. Some examples include planting wildflowers, fruit trees, windbreaks, silvopasture, coppicing trees, etc. But it's not "throw a packet of seeds out the window". Think and act big in scale.
