Do the following:

- a. Explain the difference solar collectors, between monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin film solar panels. What are the advantages of each?
- b. Describe how to safely work with solar and wind power sources.
- c. Explain how geothermal, tidal, and hyrdroelectic energy sources work.
- d. Describe ways to store energy generated by renewable systems that doesn't involve batteries.
- e. Show how to determine the needed size of a real or theoretical rewnewable energy system based on peak required wattage. Show your calculations where possible.

Do the following:

- a. Produce electricity using a solar panel that is at least 100 watts. Charge a battery and use the energy in the battery to do something useful.
- b. Produce electricity using a wind turbine that is at least 100 watts. Charge a battery and use the energy in the battery to do something useful.

Alternatively, you can do one of the above using hyrdroelectic energy if a suitable source is available to you.
